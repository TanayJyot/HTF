Slower spark than the original, Text: This replacement part is a different configuration than the original, but the main thing is the support holes lined up.  The markings on the original and this replacement made it pretty straight forward.  One wire at a time.  I did notice that the spark is not as quick to start as the original unit.<br /><br />Note:  I had to cut a small support zip tie to move the wires around...of course it was not the size I had.  Had to go to the store and get a small bag of 4&#34; zip ties."

Described my problem to someone on a online site and based upon my description, they said ALL YOU NEED IS THIS PART!  I took a chance for around $10, my refrigerator is now working great again!  More specific, my refrigerator was freezing up, i.e. the coil was clogged with ice and wasn't sending cold air to the freezer or cold storage part of my refrigerator.  This thermostat clips to a coil and sends a signal that heats the coil long enough to defrost the build-up of frost and ice, allowing the fan to blow air through the coil and into the freezer and cold storage areas to keep everything at proper temperature.  For $10, I gambled and it worked!  Thanks to online support and quick shipping, I am back to normal.  SPECIAL NOTE:  Part numbers change over time so the number on original part in my refrigerator had to be cross-referenced to the present part number.  When looking online, different websites had both and/or either part number.  I did my research and this was the BEST price by far.  PRIME MEMBER so shipping was free.  Sites that had the part cheaper, were more expensive once you added shipping costs into the total price."

I found that the ceramic pitchers \"steal\" heat from the milk during steaming, so I have switched to stainless steel.  This Fire-Maple pitcher is metal with a slick coating, maybe something like anodized but I am not sure.  In any event, the pitcher is an attractive color and the finish is very easy to clean.  The gauge markings on the inside allow you to measure the amount of milk you want, so no guessing there and you can really dial-in your work flow.  I steamed up milk and the container worked nicely.  The handle is large enough to get some fingers in for comfortable holding without getting too close to the hot milk (through the pitcher wall).  With the handsome color, this can be an attractive and highly functional addition to your coffee work flow."
